EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION NOTE
===============================================
This file represents what would happen in a real ransomware attack:
- Original file would be encrypted with strong cryptography
- Content would be completely unreadable without decryption key
- Recovery would require the attacker's key or backups
- This simulation shows the concept safely for educational purposes
