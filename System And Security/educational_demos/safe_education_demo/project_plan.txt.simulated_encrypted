RANSOMWARE RESEARCH PROJECT PLAN
==============================

GOALS:
1. Study ransomware encryption methods
2. Analyze detection evasion techniques
3. Develop countermeasures
4. Create educational simulations
5. Document findings for security community

METHODOLOGY:
- Static analysis of encryption algorithms
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Signature-based detection testing
- Machine learning model development
- Ethical hacking framework creation

This is academic research content for cybersecurity education.

EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION NOTE
===============================================
This file represents what would happen in a real ransomware attack:
- Original file would be encrypted with strong cryptography
- Content would be completely unreadable without decryption key
- Recovery would require the attacker's key or backups
- This simulation shows the concept safely for educational purposes
