CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

This thesis explores the application of deep learning techniques for 
real-time detection of zero-day ransomware attacks. Traditional signature-based
antivirus solutions fail to detect novel malware variants, creating a critical
security gap in modern computing environments.

Our approach leverages behavioral analysis and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
to identify ransomware based on its operational patterns rather than static
signatures, enabling detection of previously unseen ransomware families.
